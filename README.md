# audette_ml_exercise
ML interview exercise for Audette

### Files
- Generate.ipynb - Poorly documented notebook to create training and question data
- Demo.ipynb - an example solution with LGBM
- Exercise.ipynb - a template that appropriately loads the data and the questions

### Assignment
1. Create and test a very basic-but-functional ensemble tree classifier (eg, LightGBM) using dataset.csv.  
- The label column is "system_type".  
- Exercise.ipynb is provided to save you some time.  
- Don't overthink this -- we'll be evaluating you on step 3.  Accuracy > 80% gets you a score of 100% on step 1.

2. Apply your model to the three rows in questions.csv.

3. Write a half-page document about your model.  Speak to:
- Key assumptions made in the interest of a quick prototype
- Concerns you'd bring up to the stakeholders about the model
- Any thoughts on a data cleaning process.  Speak to which features deserve the most attention and why
- Your next steps if improving accuracy is a key consideration

4. Discuss how you'd feel about making a *very* expensive recommendation on the basis of each of the three predictions against question.csv.
