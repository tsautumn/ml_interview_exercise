# audette_ml_exercise
ML interview exercise for Audette

### Files
- Generate.ipynb - Poorly documented notebook to create training and question data
- Demo.ipynb - an example solution with LGBM
- Exercise.ipynb - a template that appropriately loads the data and the questions

### Assignment
1. Create and test a very basic-but-functional ensemble tree classifier (eg, LightGBM) using dataset.csv.  
- The label column is "system_type".  
- Exercise.ipynb is provided to save you some time.  
- Don't overthink this -- we'll be evaluating you on step 3.  Accuracy > 80% gets you a score of 100% on step 1.

2. Apply your model to the three rows in questions.csv.

3. Do a short writeup about your model.  Keep it down to about 300 words, point form is fine.  Speak to:
- Key assumptions, concerns, and limitations
- How would you verify that you haven't overfitted?
- If you were going to do some data cleaning, which features would you look at first, and why?
- Next steps in making the model more robust?

4. Imagine you're asked to make a very expensive recommendation based on the model's prediction.  How do you feel for each of row 1, 2, and 3 in questions.csv?
